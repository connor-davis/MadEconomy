# MadEconomy
This is an economy mod for Minecraft Forge 1.16.4. It adds custom blocks and items to the game such as a silver coin that players can use as a trading item.

### Auto Generated Assets
Some of the assets for the mod were automatically generated and live in the src/generated folder. They were generated via the DataGenerator class in src/main/java/tech/connordavis/madeconomy/data folder. This is thanks to using the Providers from Forge that help generate the json files needed for things like models, items, textures, loot tables and recipes.
