### Auto Generated Assets
Some of the assets for the mod were automatically generated and live in the src/generated folder. They were generated via the DataGenerator class in src/main/java/tech/connordavis/madeconomy/data folder. This is thanks to using the Providers from Forge that help generate the json files needed for things like models, items, textures, loot tables and recipes.
